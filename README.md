### Navier Stokes Momentum Conservation Model

We take a segment of air of length `l`. Using the theory of Air Dynamics and Law of Diffusion, we find the discretised momentum conservation model evaluated from a velocity time series. 

The process of development is to maximise the accuracy of the model and as well maximise the performance of the model, using a benchmark model developed in Python.

### Allen's Interval Algebra Sum of Limitting Ratios Model

The Allen's Interval Algebra technique uses input probability distributions as a function of position and then finds the sum of limitting ratios of a statistical quantity.

The process of development is to calculate the limitting ratio at each position, for which formula will be given, using a benchmark model developed in python.

## Performance Optimization Explanation

[https://github.com/nscalo/cpp-performance-samples](https://github.com/nscalo/cpp-performance-samples)

You can use:

    - Vectorization, or
    
    - Paralleization using Multithreading or multiprocessing, or

    - MPI

to minimise the time shown in the repository, without affecting the accuracy of the model
